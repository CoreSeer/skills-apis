# European Skills/Competences, qualifications and occupations (ESCO)

* [ESCO API](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/api)

[ESCO](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal) is the European multilingual classification of Skills, Competences, and Occupations.

ESCO works as a dictionary describing, identifying, and classifying professional occupations and skills, which are relevant for the EU labour market and training. These concepts can be used for services like matching jobseekers to jobs based on their skills and suggesting training to people, who wish to re- or upskill.

ESCO concepts and descriptions can help with the following:

* which knowledges and skills are usually required from those working in a specific occupation;
* which knowledges, skills, and competences are developed as a result of a specific qualification;
* undestand which qualifications are in demand or frequently sought after by employers from those searching for work in a specific occupation;
