# Europass Digital Credentials / The Euroropass Learning Model

Meant to make it easier to present proof of your qualifications and other learning achievements across Europe by providing electronic, tamper-proof digital credentials. The Europass Learning Model aims to capture the results of any non-formal and formal learning across Europe, as well as the validation of non-formal and informal learning. The Europass Digital Credentials are sharable with employers, education and training institutions, and other organisations, which may need information regarding your qualifications. By viewing your Europass Digital Credential they'll be able to verify that your qualifications are real and belong to you automatically.
